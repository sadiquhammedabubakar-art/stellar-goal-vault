|----------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Already initialized | `"already initialized"` | High | Do not call again; contract is already set up |
| `min_contribution <= 0` | `"min_contribution must be positive"` | High | Call with a positive integer (minimum 1 stroop) |
| Caller not authorized | Soroban auth failure | High | Ensure caller signs with the `admin` address |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Full Campaign Lifecycle

Deploy and initialize the contract, create a campaign, contribute, wait for deadline, and claim.

```typescript
// --- Setup ---
// 1. Initialize contract (admin = GABC..., min_contribution = 100 stroops)
//    This is called once when the contract is first deployed.
//    Cost: ~24,000 gas units
//    Storage: sets Admin, Paused=false, MinContribution=100

// 2. Create campaign
//    creator = GBCD..., target = 10_000 stroops, deadline = now + 7 days
//    accepted_tokens = [USDC_token_address], metadata = "Help build a school"
//    Returns: campaign_id = 1
//    Cost: ~54,000 gas units
//    Storage: Campaign(1), NextCampaignId=1, ContributorCap(1) not stored (0 = no cap)
//    Event: CampaignCreated { campaign_id: 1, creator: GBCD..., ... }

// --- Contributing ---
// 3. Contributor GEFG... contributes 500 USDC
//    contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG..., token=USDC, amount=500)
//    Cost: ~60,000 gas units
//    Effects:
//      - TokenClient.transfer(GEFG..., contract_address, 500)
//      - Campaign(1).pledged_amount: 0 → 500
//      - Campaign(1).contributor_count: 0 → 1
//      - HasContributed(1, GEFG...) = true
//      - CampaignTokenBalance(1, USDC) = 500
//    Event: CampaignPledged { campaign_id: 1, contributor: GEFG..., ... }

// --- Waiting ---
// 4. Wait until deadline passes (env.ledger().timestamp() > campaign.deadline)

// --- Claiming ---
// 5. Creator claims funds
//    claim(campaign_id=1, creator=GBCD...)
//    Cost: ~42,000 gas units (1 token)
//    Effects:
//      - Campaign(1).claimed = true
//      - TokenClient.transfer(contract_address, GBCD..., 500)
//      - CampaignTokenBalance(1, USDC) = 0
//    Event: CampaignClaimed { campaign_id: 1, creator: GBCD..., ... }
```

### Example 2: Cancel + Refund

Create a campaign, contribute, cancel before deadline, and refund.

```typescript
// --- Setup ---
// initialize(admin=GABC..., min_contribution=100)
// create_campaign(creator=GBCD..., target=10_000, deadline=now+30d, ...)
//   → campaign_id = 1

// --- Contribute ---
// contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG..., token=USDC, amount=500)
//   → Campaign(1).pledged_amount = 500, contributor_count = 1

// --- Cancel ---
// cancel_campaign(campaign_id=1, creator=GBCD...)
//   → Campaign(1).canceled = true
//   Event: CampaignCanceled { campaign_id: 1, creator: GBCD... }

// --- Refund (individual) ---
// refund(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG...)
//   → Tokens transferred back to GEFG...
//   → Campaign(1).pledged_amount = 0
//   Event: CampaignRefunded { campaign_id: 1, contributor: GEFG..., ... }
```

### Example 3: Deadline Extension Governance

Multiple contributors vote to extend a campaign deadline.

```typescript
// --- Setup ---
// create_campaign(creator=GBCD..., target=10_000, deadline=now+14d, ...)
//   → campaign_id = 1

// Contributors GEFG... and GHIF... each contribute
// contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG..., token=USDC, amount=5_000)
// contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GHIF..., token=USDC, amount=3_000)
//   → contributor_count = 2

// --- Extension Request ---
//   contributor_count = 2, need >50% → need 2 approvals
// request_deadline_extension(campaign_id=1, caller=GEFG..., new_deadline=now+21d)
//   → ExtensionRequest(1) = { new_deadline: now+21d, requested_by: GEFG..., approval_count: 1 }
//   Event: ExtensionRequested { campaign_id: 1, requested_by: GEFG..., new_deadline: now+21d }

// --- Approval (majority reached) ---
// approve_extension(campaign_id=1, caller=GHIF...)
//   → approval_count: 1 → 2
//   → 2 * 2 > 2 = true → deadline applied
//   → Campaign(1).deadline = now+21d
//   → ExtensionRequest(1) cleared
//   No new event (the extension application is implicit in approve_extension)
```

### Example 4: Multi-Token Campaign

Campaign accepts multiple token types.

```typescript
// --- Create multi-token campaign ---
// accepted_tokens = [USDC, EURC, BRL]
// create_campaign(creator=GBCD..., accepted_tokens=[USDC, EURC, BRL], target=15_000, ...)
//   → campaign_id = 1

// --- Contribute with different tokens ---
// contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG..., token=USDC, amount=5_000)
//   → CampaignTokenBalance(1, USDC) = 5_000
//   → pledged_amount = 5_000

// contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG..., token=EURC, amount=3_000)
//   → CampaignTokenBalance(1, EURC) = 3_000
//   → pledged_amount = 8_000 (contributor_count stays 1, same contributor)

// contribute(campaign_id=1, contributor=GHIF..., token=BRL, amount=7_000)
//   → CampaignTokenBalance(1, BRL) = 7_000
//   → pledged_amount = 15_000 (reached target)
//   → contributor_count = 2

// --- Claim ---
// claim(campaign_id=1, creator=GBCD...)
//   → Transfers USDC(5k) + EURC(3k) + BRL(7k) to creator
//   → 3 CampaignClaimed events emitted (one per token)
```

### Example 5: Read-Only Queries

Checking campaign state without mutation.

```typescript
// --- Check campaign state ---
// get_campaign(campaign_id=1)
//   → Returns full Campaign struct:
//     { creator, accepted_tokens, target_amount: 10_000,
//       pledged_amount: 5_000, deadline: ..., claimed: false,
//       canceled: false, metadata: "Help build a school",
//       contributor_count: 1, created_at: ... }

// --- Check specific contribution ---
// get_contribution(campaign_id=1, contributor=GEFG..., token=USDC)
//   → Returns 5_000

// --- Check admin ---
// get_admin() → GABC...

// --- Check version ---
// get_version() → "0.1.0"

// --- Check extension status ---
// get_extension_request(campaign_id=1)
//   → Returns Option<ExtensionRequest>
//     None if no pending request, Some(request) if one exists
```

## Storage Layout

All ledger keys are encoded as `DataKey` variants. Instance keys are stored with `env.storage().instance()`, persistent keys with `env.storage().persistent()`. No temporary storage is used by this contract.

### Ledger Keys

| Ledger key | Format | Value type | Persistence | TTL | Migration impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Admin` | `DataKey::Admin` | `Address` | Instance | Contract instance lifetime | Survives upgrade; not modified by `migrate()`. |
| `Paused` | `DataKey::Paused` | `bool` | Instance | Contract instance lifetime | Survives upgrade; migration does not unpause. |
| `MinContribution` | `DataKey::MinContribution` | `i128` | Instance | Contract instance lifetime | Survives upgrade; not modified by `migrate()`. |
| `NextCampaignId` | `DataKey::NextCampaignId` | `u64` | Instance | Contract instance lifetime | Survives upgrade; incremented by `create_campaign()` and `migrate()`. |
| `DeployInfo` | `DataKey::DeployInfo` | `DeployInfo` | Instance | Contract instance lifetime | Written lazily by `get_version()`/`get_deploy_info()`; stays from old version unless cleared before upgrade. |
| `Campaign` | `DataKey::Campaign { campaign_id }` | `Campaign` | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Created by `create_campaign()` and `migrate()`. |
| `CampaignContributors` | `DataKey::CampaignContributors { campaign_id }` | `Vec<Address>` | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Not copied by `migrate()`; rebuilt from new contributions. |
| `ContributorCap` | `DataKey::ContributorCap { campaign_id }` | `i128` | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Stored only when `max_per_contributor > 0`; not restored by `migrate()` because `Campaign` does not carry the cap. |
| `Contribution` | `DataKey::Contribution { campaign_id, contributor, token }` | `i128` | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Created/updated by `contribute()`; not copied by `migrate()`. |
| `CampaignTokenBalance` | `DataKey::CampaignTokenBalance { campaign_id, token }` | `i128` | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Created after first contribution for the pair; not copied by `migrate()`. |
| `ExtensionRequest` | `DataKey::ExtensionRequest { campaign_id }` | `ExtensionRequest` | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Created by `request_deadline_extension()`; cleared by `approve_extension()`; not migrated. |
| `MigrationMap` | `DataKey::MigrationMap { old_contract_id, source_id }` | `u64` (new campaign ID) | Persistent | 31 days, extended on read/write | Written only by `migrate()` to skip duplicate source IDs. |

### Storage Access by Entry Point

| Entry point | Storage keys touched |
|---|---|
| `initialize` | `Admin`, `Paused`, `MinContribution` |
| `set_paused` | `Paused` |
| `create_campaign` | `NextCampaignId`, `Campaign`, `CampaignContributors`, `ContributorCap` (only when `max_per_contributor > 0`) |
| `cancel_campaign` | `Campaign` |
| `update_metadata` | `Campaign` |
| `contribute` | `Campaign`, `Contribution`, `CampaignTokenBalance`, `CampaignContributors` (first contribution only) |
| `claim` | `Campaign`, `CampaignTokenBalance` (each token with a balance) |
| `refund` | `Campaign`, `Contribution`, `CampaignTokenBalance`, `CampaignContributors` (when total contribution reaches zero) |
| `refund_all` | `Campaign`, `CampaignContributors`, `Contribution`, `CampaignTokenBalance` |
| `request_deadline_extension` | `ExtensionRequest` |
| `approve_extension` | `ExtensionRequest`, `Campaign` (when deadline is applied) |
| `migrate` | `NextCampaignId`, `Campaign`, `MigrationMap` |
| `get_campaign` | `Campaign` |
| `get_contribution` | `Contribution` |
| `get_campaign_token_balance` | `CampaignTokenBalance` |
| `get_contributor_count` | `Campaign` |
| `get_min_contribution` | `MinContribution` |
| `get_paused` | `Paused` |
| `get_admin` | `Admin` |
| `get_next_campaign_id`, `get_campaign_count` | `NextCampaignId` |
| `get_version`, `get_deploy_info` | `DeployInfo` |
| `get_extension_request` | `ExtensionRequest` |

### Storage Budget Analysis

Budget for 100 campaigns and 1,000 pledges. "Pledge" is one unique `(campaign_id, contributor, token)` tuple; repeated contributions update existing entries and do not add new entries.

| Entry type | Per campaign base | 100 campaigns + 1,000 unique pledges |
|---|---|---|
| `Campaign` | 1 | 100 |
| `CampaignContributors` | 1 | 100 |
| `ContributorCap` | 0 if cap is 0, else 1 | 0–100 |
| `Contribution` | per unique pledge | 1,000 |
| `CampaignTokenBalance` | per distinct `(campaign_id, token)` pair with a non-zero balance | 1–1,000 |
| `ExtensionRequest` | 0 unless a request is pending | 0 + pending requests |
| `MigrationMap` | 0 unless `migrate()` is used | 0 |

Total entries for 100 campaigns and 1,000 unique pledges:

- Minimum (no cap entries, one token used per campaign): 100 + 100 + 0 + 1,000 + 100 = 1,300.
- Maximum (all campaigns have caps and every pledge uses a distinct campaign/token pair): 100 + 100 + 100 + 1,000 + 1,000 = 2,300.
- Typical pending extension requests add one `ExtensionRequest` entry per campaign with an open request.

### Upgrade Migration Impact

- Instance keys (`Admin`, `Paused`, `MinContribution`, `NextCampaignId`) survive code upgrades and are not reset by `migrate()`.
- `DeployInfo` is lazy; if it already exists it continues to report the old deployment version/timestamp. Clear it before upgrade if the new version should be recorded on first read.
- `migrate()` writes `MigrationMap` for each source ID, writes new `Campaign` entries, and advances `NextCampaignId`. Source campaign IDs are not reused.
- `CampaignContributors`, `Contribution`, `CampaignTokenBalance`, `ContributorCap`, and pending `ExtensionRequest` entries are not recreated by `migrate()` because the current `migrate` signature accepts only `Campaign` structs. These keys must be preserved through a separate snapshot/restore or re-populated by post-migration operations.
